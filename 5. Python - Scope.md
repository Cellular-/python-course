## Defining your own functions

- Create a new Python script and define a new function that takes two parameters, `word1` and `word2` and returns `True` if the words lengths are the same.

- ***Advanced*** Define a new function that takes one parameter named `a_function` and executes that function. No return values needed.
## Logical and relational operators

For each of the programs below, figure out what each will print.

```python
over_threshold = True

print(over_threshold == not False)
```

```python
is_raining = True
is_raining = not is_raining

if is_raining:
	print('Its raining')
```

```python
should_retry = True
num_retries = 5

while should_retry and num_retries > 0:
	print('Retrying...')

	num_retries = num_retries - 1
```

```python
current = 5
max_allowed = 6
is_valid = (1 > 0) and (current <= max_allowed)
```
# Theory Refresher

## First class objects

In Python, first class objects are objects that can be:

- Passed as arguments to functions: You can pass objects to functions as parameters.
- Returned from functions: Functions can return objects.
- Assigned to variables: You can assign objects to variables.
- Stored in data structures: Objects can be stored in data structures like lists, dictionaries, etc.

Pretty much everything in Python is a first class object, even functions. To understand this concept better, write some functions that take and return other functions.
## Cross platform

Python, like many languages, is made to run on many popular operating systems like Windows, Linux and MacOS. This is possible due to the Python interpreter and virtual machine.

When you write a Python script and run it using the `> python` command, you're actually starting an instance of the Python interpreter which takes your script and compiles it to `bytecode`.

`Bytecode` is executed by the Python virtual machine and is platform independent. So you can write your scripts once and run on any operating system.
# Scope

Scope is the mechanism that determines how to search for objects and variables referenced by your code and is managed by the Python interpreter. There are 4 levels of scope:

![[scopes.jpg]]

When your code references a variable or object, the Python interpreter first searches the local scope then the enclosing scope then global then built-in scope. The interpreter searches the scopes in this order and if it cannot find an object that your code is referencing, you'll get an error.
## Types of scope

### Local (function)

Local scope contains the objects and variables defined inside a function. Those objects and variables are only accessible by the code in the function itself.

```python
def my_func():
	# local scope starting here
	x = 1
	print(x) # interpreter searches for x, finds it in my_func local scope
	# local scope ending here

my_func() # prints 1
```

If you try to access variables defined inside `my_func` outside of the function, you get an error:

```python
# module_scope.py
def my_func():
	x = 1

print(x)
```

That's because `my_func` is defined the script's, `module_scope.py`, global scope, but `x` is defined in the local scope of `my_func`.
### Enclosing

Enclosing scope refers to nested functions scope. When you define a function, `func_2`, inside another function, `func_1`, `func_2` is the local scope and `func_1` is the enclosing scope. Any variables or objects inside `func_1` are available for `func_2` to reference.

Example:

```python
# nestedfunctions.py

def func_1():
	# enclosing scope starts here
	x = 1

	def func_2():
		# local scope begins here
		print('func_2 can access x from func_1')
		print('Value of x from func_1 is: ', x)
		# local scope ends here

	func_2() # execute func_2 inside of func_1
	# enclosing scope ends here

func_1()
```

What should this code print? There are two variables `x`. Remember the order of scopes that the interpreter searches for variables and objects.
### `nonlocal` keyword

In the example above, `func_2` could access the variable `x`, but if it attempted to change the value of `x`, an error would occur. See below:

```python
def func_1():
	# enclosing scope starts here
	x = 1

	def func_2():
		# local scope begins here
		x = x + 2
		print('func_2 can access x from func_1')
		print('Value of x from func_1 is: ', x)
		# local scope ends here

	func_2() # execute func_2 inside of func_1
	# enclosing scope ends here

func_1()
```

Why? You might think that when `func_2` executes

```python
x = x + 2
```

that the variable `x` defined inside `func_1` would be used. But actually, the interpreter looks for a variable `x` in `func_2` local scope. It doesn't find it, so an error is thrown.

To fix this, we use the `nonlocal` keyword. This forces the Python interpreter to search for a variable or object in the function's enclosing scope.

```python
def func_1():
	# enclosing scope starts here
	x = 1

	def func_2():
		# local scope begins here
		nonlocal x
		x = x + 2
		print('func_2 can access x from func_1')
		print('Value of x from func_1 is: ', x)
		# local scope ends here

	func_2() # execute func_2 inside of func_1
	# enclosing scope ends here

func_1()
```

One line of code was added inside `func_2`:

```python
nonlocal x
```

Now, `func_2` can associate the variable `x` with `func_1`'s `x` and change the value safely.

What should the program above print now?
### Global (module)

Up to this point, we've been calling the programs made "scripts", but the formal name is "module". Any single file that we name is a `module`. A collection of `modules` is called a `package` but that will be covered later.

Let's look at a module, `mymodule.py`

```python
# mymodule.py

x = 100

print(x)
```

`x` lives in `mymodule.py` module scope. This means any other code in this module can access `x`, even other functions defined in `mymodule.py`.

For example:

```python
x = 100

def print_number():
	print(x)
```

Since `print_number` references a variable `x`, it first looks in its local scope. It doesn't find it there so it searches the next scope, `global (module)` scope and finds an `x` there. But what if you want to edit the value of `x` inside the `print_number` function?

There's another keyword similar to `nonlocal`.
#### `global` keyword

The `global` keyword is used to force the Python interpreter to search for a variable or object in the `global` (module) scope.

Example:

```python
counter = 0
def increment_by_1():
	global counter
	counter = counter + 1
	print(counter)

increment_by_1()
increment_by_1()
increment_by_1()
```

By placing the `global` keyword in front of the `variable`, each time you execute `increment_by_1`, the function:

- Skips looking for `counter` in the local scope
- Directly searches the `global` scope
- Finds `counter` in the `global` scope
- Increments its value by 1 and saves it back to `counter`
- Then prints the value

You might be tempted to use this, but it's an indicator that your code could be written differently.
### Built-in

Built-in scope is the last ("highest") level of scope the Python interpreter will check for variables and references. It contains variables and objects (like functions) that are accessible anywhere in a Python program like the functions `len`, and `str`.

Unlike the other scopes, you should not add or remove variables or objects from this scope. That would cause compatibility issues when you run your Python code on other machines that have unmodified built-in scopes.

The example below demonstrates using the built-in scope. Nowhere is the function `len` defined. However, the program searches all of the other scopes for that function and finally finds it in the built-in scope.

```python
# builtinscope.py

my_name = 'Steven'
print(len(my_name))
```
### Common mistakes

#### Using variables not in scope

In this example, the function `greet_user` tries accessing two variables: `greeting` and `user_name`. However, `user_name` isn't in the local, module (global), or built-in scope so the interpreter will throw an error.

***Fix the code to resolve this error***

```python
def greet_user(users_name='Kevin'):
	greeting = 'Hello,'
	print(greeting, user_name)

greet_user()
```
#### Using the incorrect scope

What should this program print? If it doesn't do what you hope it to do then fix it so that the program increments correctly. Think about which scopes your variables should be in and keyword you could use.

```python
def increment():
	counter = 1
	counter = counter + 1
	print(counter)

increment_counter()
increment_counter()
increment_counter()
```
### Avoid using global scope

In general, don't use global scope too often. Avoid it if you can. Putting too many variables or objects in your global scope makes code hard to follow, allows for any other code to modify those values and testing becomes difficult.

Look at the counter module below:

```python
counter = 0
def increment_by_1():
	global counter
	counter = counter + 1
	print(counter)

increment_by_1()
increment_by_1()
increment_by_1()
```

Sure, this program now provides a real counter that can increment some global variable by 1. However, there's a serious flaw. Any other function in this module can also modify the `counter` variable.

What will this program print?

```python
# badcounter.py

counter = 0
def increment_by_1():
	global counter
	counter = counter + 1
	print(counter)

def increment_by_5():
	global counter
	counter = counter + 5
	print(counter)

increment_by_1()
increment_by_1()
increment_by_5()
increment_by_1()
```

If you think:

```
> python badcounter.py
> 1
> 2
> 7
> 8
```

You'd be right. In the functions, `increment_by_1` and `increment_by_5`, both use the `global` keyword in front of the `counter` variable which forces the Python interpreter to look for that variable in the global scope. Since both functions can now modify the same variable, you have inconsistencies.

At any time, either function can change the value of `counter`. If you're using this program to count the number of times a file is opened, for example, then you'd expect the counter to increment once each time the file is opened not 5 times.
