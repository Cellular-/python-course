# Setup

## Get Python

In your browser of choice, search for "Python3 download". Then, follow the instructions to install the language.
### Did it work?

Open a new terminal on your computer. Then enter this command:

`> python3 --version`

You should see something like this (version number may be slightly different):

`> Python 3.11.4`
## Get Visual Studio Code

In your browser again, search for "visual studio code" and download/install the latest version. Visual Studio Code (VS Code), is a lightweight text editor and will be used to write and execute Python scripts.
## Get Obsidian Notes

Optional but highly recommended.
## Create new folder

Navigate to a directory on your computer, then create a new folder called `python-learning` or something similar. This folder will contain your python scripts.
## Open new folder

Run VS Code then open the folder you just created.

Basic setup is done.
# Executing Python code

There are a few ways to [[Appendix#Executing Python Code|run Python code]], we will focus mostly on using the [[Appendix#Executing Python Code|REPL and interpreter on the terminal]].
## How Python code runs on the terminal

Below is a basic Python program named `somescript.py`.

```python
# somescript.py

print('Hello, world!')
print('Hello again, world!')
```

`somescript.py` is just a regular, old file in your `python-learning` folder. If I ran `somescript.py` on my terminal like this:

`> python3 somescript.py`

I would see this output on my terminal:

```
> Hello, world!
> Hello again, world!
```

That's because in a simple script like this, the [[Appendix#Python Architecture#Interpreter]|Python interpreter]] reads the first command of the script `print("Hello, world!)`, executes the command, processes the results then moves to the next command.

Once all commands in a script are executed, both the script and Python interpreter exit. The important takeaway is that you will write a Python script then "give it" to the interpreter to execute it.
# Variables and types

## Naming and defining variables

Variables (meaning to change) are names you assign to values in your programs. To define a variable, come up with a descriptive name for it. What's a good variable name for someone's age? Probably `age`. I'll use that name and assign it a value. See below:

```python
# naming_variable.py

# I need a variable that stores someone's age.
age = 25
print(age)
```

Running this script on the terminal:

```
> python3 naming_variable.py
> 25
```

There are no enforced rules on variable naming conventions, however, try and be descriptive. Also, most variables should be all lowercase with each word separated by an `_` symbol.

For example, a variable for describing the current temperature:

```python
# variable_format.py

current_temperature = 75
```
## Undefined variables

Be careful not to use a variable you haven't assigned. The [[Appendix#Python Architecture#Interpreter]|Python interpreter]] will freak out and "throw" an error and exit your script. For example:

```python
# variable_doesnt_exist.py
print(weight)
```

Output:

```
> python3 variable_doesnt_exist.py
> Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'weight' is not defined
>
```

The [[Appendix#Python Architecture#Interpreter]|Python interpreter]] can only use variables that are defined.
## Assigning values (types) to variables

In the script below, I've defined the variable `message` and assigned the value 'Hello, world!' using the `=` operator [more about operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp). The general format for assigning a single value to a variable:

`variable_name = value`

```python
# myscript.py

message = 'Hello, world!'
print(message)
```
### Python types

Variables are assigned values. "Values" refers to the different types of objects you can create and manipulate in Python. See list of basic Python types and objects below.

| Type            | Python Symbol                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Text Type:      | `str`                              |
| Numeric Types:  | `int`, `float`, `complex`          |
| Sequence Types: | `list`, `tuple`, `range`           |
| Mapping Type:   | `dict`                             |
| Set Types:      | `set`, `frozenset`                 |
| Boolean Type:   | `bool`                             |
| Binary Types:   | `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview` |
| None Type:      | `NoneType`                         |
[Learn more about Python types]([Python Data Types](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp))
## Assigning values to variable continued...

Values in quotes (single or double) are `str` types in Python. Notice, I did not specify that `message` is a `str` type. This is [[Appendix#Type inference|type inference]] and is a property of Python and other languages like Scala, Rust and Haskell.

Now, when I reference the `message` variable in my script, the Python interpreter remembers the value I've assigned to it and uses that value.

Again, the output if I ran `myscript.py` from the terminal:

```
> python3 myscript.py
> Hello, world!
```

***Learning Check***

Given the following Python script, what output do you expect?

```python
# another_script.py

message = "Hello, world!"
print(message)
print(message)
```

Answer (click to show):

```spoiler-block
> Hello, world!
> Hello, world!
```

## Working with numbers

Focusing on the `int` type, Python lets you manipulate numbers like you normally would in math.

For example, I could add, subtract, divide, and multiply numbers:

```python
# numbers.py

print(1 + 1)
print(1 - 1)
print(1 * 1)
print(1 / 1)
```

If I run this on the terminal, I get:

```
> python3 numbers.py
> 2
> 0
> 1
> 1
```

Let's assign some number values to variables:

```python
# number_vars.py

my_physical_age = 34
my_mental_age = 25
how_old_my_knees_feel = 45

print('I am', my_physical_age)
print('But I mentally feel', my_mental_age)
print('And my knees feel', how_old_my_knees_feel)
print(my_physical_age + my_mental_age)
```

Running this:

```
> python3 number_vars.py
> I am 34
> But I mentally feel 25
> And my knees feel 45
> 59
```

When you need decimal places, you can work with `float` or `decimal` types instead.
### Mixing types

In the `number_vars.py` script, I've introduced a couple new things: assigning a variable a number value (`int`). What if I try to add a `str` and `int` together?

```python
# another_script.py

print('hello' + 12)
```

Running this:

```
> python3 another_script.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
> 
```

I get an error. Why? That's due to the Python interpreter's type-checking system. The interpreter checks if the types and operators in a program are compatible. If not, then the interpreter "throws" an exception and a message explaining the issue.

In this case, the error is related to concatenating `str` and `int`. Concatenate refers to the `+` operator. In Python, I can concatenate two or more `str` objects using the `+` operator:

```python
# add_two_strings.py

print('Adding strings ' + 'is weird!')
```

Output:

```
> python3 add_two_strings.py
> Adding strings is weird!
```

If I wanted to concatenate a `str` and `int`, I'd have to [[Appendix#Programming Languages#Type casting|use type casting to convert an object of one type to another]] like so:

```python
# cast_str_to_int.py
message = 'I am '
age_int = 25
age_str = str(age_int)

# Now, I can concatenate message and age_str because they're both strings.
print(message, age_str)
```

Output:
```
> python3 cast_str_to_int.py
> I am 25
```
## Bool

The `bool` type (short for boolean) takes on one of two values:

`True` or `False`

`bool` types can be assigned to a variable and are most useful in #conditions, #loops and #expressions which we will talk about later. An example usage below:

```python
is_it_raining = True
if is_it_raining:
	print('Make sure to bring your umbrella.')
else:
	print('You can wear shorts!')
```
## None

The `None` is used to represent "nothing" or the absence of a value. You can assign `None` to a variable indicating that its initial value is "nothing" then assign some other value to it later.
## Assigning a variable a new value

So we've talked about assigning a value to a variable. But what if the variable needs to change. After all, it's a variable (meaning liable to change).

Here's an example:

```python
# my_name.py

my_full_name = 'Steven'
print('My full name is', my_full_name)
```

Full names typically include both your first and last name, so let's modify the Python code to reflect that.

```python
# my_name.py

my_full_name = 'Steven'
print('My full name is', my_full_name)

my_full_name = 'Steven Lineses'
print('My full name is', my_full_name)
```

***Learning Check***

If I run the `my_name.py` script on the terminal, what is the output?

Answer:

```spoiler-block
> python3 my_name.py
> My full name is Steven
> My full name is Steven Lineses
```
## Lists, tuples and ranges

### Lists

Lists are one of the most important and widely used types in Python. A list is a [[Appendix#Programming Languages#Mutability]|mutable]] data structure used to store elements of any type (even other lists) in a specific order.

For example, here is a list of `int` values.

```python
# numbers_list.py

# this is a comment. comments are useful. you should comment often

#             0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
#### List indexing

Elements in any list are *indexed* meaning they are assigned a number to represent their position in the list. The starting index of every list is `0` and increases by `1` for each next element in the list. In the `numbers_list.py` script above, look at the number above each element. That is the elements index in the list.

By using an element's index, I can pinpoint it and process it further. For example:

```python
# numbers_list.py

my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

# Printing the first 3 elements in my_numbers list
print(my_numbers[0]) # 0 is the first elements index
print(my_numbers[1]) # 1 is the second elements index
print(my_numbers[2]) # 2 is the third elements index
```

Output:

```
> python3 numbers_list.py
> 1
> 2
> 3
```

You'll notice that there are 8 elements and 8 indices in `my_numbers`. However, since indexing starts at 0, the largest index is 7. 7 is the index of the last element in the list.

If you try this:

```python
# invalid_index.py

my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
print(my_numbers[8])
```

If you run this script on the terminal, you'll get:

```
> python3 invalid_index.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
>
```

This is an IndexError. "list index out of range" means that 8 is not a valid list index. Since we already determined that the highest index in `my_numbers` is 7, we cannot use 8. Remember:

***All list indices start with 0 and end with (number of elements in the list - 1).***

***Learning check***

Write a Python script to print the last element of `my_numbers`.

```spoiler-block
# last_num.py

print(my_numbers[7])
```
#### Adding to a list

```python
# add_to_list.py

my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
my_numbers_new = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].append(9)
```

Or

```python
# add_two_lists.py

my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
my_numbers_new = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] + [9]
```
#### Removing from a list

```python
# save_last_item.py

my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
last_num = my_numbers.pop()
print(last_num)
```

```
> python save_last_item.py
> 8
```

Or

```python
# delete_last_num.py
my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
del my_numbers[7]
```

Or

```python
# delete_first_3_items.py

my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
del my_numbers[0:3]
```
#### Replacing elements in a list

```python
# replace_items_in_list.py
my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
my_numbers[0] = 2 # change the list's first element to the value 2
```

Or

```python
# replace_a_slice.py

my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
my_numbers[0:3] = [-1,-2,-3]
print(my_numbers)
```

```
> python3 replace_a_slice.py
> [-1,-2,-3,4,5,6,7,8]
```
#### List Slicing

Accessing each element by it's index is useful, but what if you want to access a range of list elements? You can use *list slicing*. List slicing follows the format:

`my_list[START_INDEX:END_INDEX`]

`START_INDEX` can be any valid index, in our case, any number between 0-7. 

`END_INDEX` can also be numbers 0-7, *however*, `END_INDEX` must be equal to or larger than `START_INDEX` otherwise you'll get no values. `END_INDEX` is also non-inclusive which means the slice contains the element up to `END_INDEX` - 1.

```python
# list_slicing.py

my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
first_three_nums = my_numbers[0:3] # the index 3 IS NOT included in the slice
print(first_three_nums)
```

```output
> python3 list_slicing.py
> [1, 2, 3]
```

List slicing *returns (gives you back) a value of type List*. Meaning, when you slice a list, you are free to do anything you can normally do to a list, to that slice.

Example:

```python
# slicing.py

my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
my_slice = my_numbers[0:3] # has value of [1,2,3]
print(my_slice[0])
print(my_slice[2])
```

Output:

```
> python slicing.py
> 1
> 3
```
### Tuples

Tuples are another important data structure used to store values. Tuples still support indexing, slicing, and preserving order.

Tuples are created like so:

```python
# new_tuple.py

my_tuple = (1, 2, '3', 'four')
```

Notice, I can store values of different types in tuples. Same thing applies to lists.

The biggest difference between lists and tuples is that tuples are [[Appendix#Programming Languages#Mutability|immutable]]. You cannot change individual elements in a tuple; you must create a new tuple with new values.

```python
# reassign_tuple.py

ages = (24, 42, 53)
ages[0] = 99
```

Running this on the terminal will throw an error:

`TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment`

***Use tuples when the your values should not be changed.***
### Ranges

A range is an [[Appendix#Programming Languages#Mutability|immutable]], sequence of numbers. Ranges support slicing, order, and iteration. The `range` function takes 3 [[Appendix#Programming Languages#Arguments]|arguments]] in this order:

`start` - number that the sequence starts at 
`stop` - number where the sequence stops (not included)
`step` - number specifying the increment value

I can create a range of numbers starting at `0` and ending at `12` that increments by `1`with the following code.

```python
# range_example.py

my_range = range(0, 13, 1)
print(my_range[0])
print(my_range[1])
```

```
> python range_example.py
> 0
> 1
```

Ranges are great for creating a sequence of numbers and are especially used in [[3. Python - Basics#For loops]|for loops]].
## Dictionaries

# Control flow

 [[Appendix#Control Flow]|Control flow]] statements direct the path of your programs and become powerful when used with [[3. Python - Basics#Logical operators|logical operators]] and [[3. Python - Basics#Loops (control flow)]|loops]].
## if, elif and else
 
`if`, `elif` and `else` are used to decide if a part of your program should run or not. Control flow will start with `if` and can "branch" off to other parts of your program based on some conditions created with [[3. Python - Basics#Logical operators]|logical operators]]. `if` and `elif` are followed by conditions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`.

Here's a scenario:

Let's say you want to go on a walk, but it looks like it might rain outside. It's either going to rain or not rain, so what will you do in each case? Let's model this with Python.

```python
# walk_in_rain.py

is_raining = True

if is_raining:
	print('Bring your umbrella')
else:
	print('No umbrella needed')
```

Since `is_raining` evaluates to `True`, the code inside the block following the `if` statement is executed.

Here's the output:

```
> python3 walk_in_rain.py
> Bring your umbrella
```

The `else` block only gets executed if none of the above `if` `elif` statements evaluate to `True`.

***Learning check***

Given the following code, what is the output?

```python
# walk_in_rain_2.py

is_raining = False

if is_raining:
	print('Bring your umbrella')
else:
	print('No umbrella needed')
```

Answer:

```spoiler-block
> python3 walk_in_rain_2.py
> No umbrella needed
```
# Logical operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. In the above example, we only cared about if it was raining to figure out if we needed to bring an umbrella. But what if you need to check more than one scenario? That's where `and`, `or` and `not` come in.

Here's a modified version of the script that uses `and`:

```python
# raining_and_snowing.py

is_raining = True
is_snowing = True

if is_raining and is_snowing:
    print('Bring your umbrella and your scarf')
elif is_raining:
	print('Bring your umbrella')
else:
    print('Its a nice day')
```
# Loops (control flow)

Loops are a fundamental building block for advanced control flow. They are used to repeat a unit of work (like a mini-program) within your program.
## For loops

```python
my_numbers = [1,2,3,4]
for number in numbers:
	print(number)
```

## While loops

While loops keep looping until the condition is not `True`. In the code example below, `something_is_true` is 

```python
something_is_true = True
while something_is_true:
	print('Something is still true')
	something_is_true = False

print('Something is not true anymore')
```

# Code Challenge

#1 Use a list of letters and print new words to your terminal only using list indexing, slicing and the print function. No control flow statements or conditions.

#2 Write a program that uses a loop to iterate over a list of letters and counts the number of a specific letter
