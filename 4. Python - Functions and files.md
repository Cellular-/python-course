## Looping through numbers

Loop through the numbers below and print the number if it is greater than a number stored in a variable called `threshold`.

```python
numbers = [1,13,6,42,59,17,3,10,4,9]
```
## Reordering a list

Reorder the following list so that it contains the value `['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`. You may use loops, if statements, slicing, indexing.

```python
characters = ['h', 'o', 'n', 'p', 'y', 't']
```
# Theory refresher

## Python interpreter as a process

When we run a Python script on the terminal using the Python interpreter:

```
> python myscript.py
```

What's actually happening is the operating system finds the Python executable (python.exe), that you installed, starts a new process (program running in the background) and executes the script in the process.

To prove this, run the Python interpreter from your terminal which starts the REPL:

```
> python
```

Then, open up your task manager. You should see a entry in your task manager list called Python. That's the process you created by starting the Python interpreter on your terminal.
## What happens when I create and assign a variable

When you define and name a variable then assign it a value like so:

```python
my_variable = 42
```

the Python interpreter or the OS finds an available chunk of your computers memory and uses that to store the variables value.

Now, your variable actually holds the location of the chunk of memory that's storing the value. When you use your variable in your script, the interpreter uses the memory location to find the value and use it.

To prove this, create a new Python script, define an assign a variable some value, then write this command out into the script and run it:

```python
# variables_memory_address.py

favorite_color = 'blue'
print(hex(id(favorite_color)))
```

***Variables hold a location in your computer's memory and use that to find the actual value you assigned to the variable***.
## Immutability

Immutable objects in Python like `int`, `str`, `tuple` and `bool` cannot be changed once created. Look at these examples:

Here, I'm attempting to change the first element in a list and tuple. I can do this with lists since they are `mutable` but not with tuples. Tuples are immutable.

```python
# immutability_lists_tuples.py

my_list = [1,2,3]
my_tuple = (1,2,3)

# change first element to number 5
my_list[0] = 5 # Valid

my_tuple[0] = 5 # Error, tuples are not mutable (changeable)
```

I want a new number that increases my original number by 1. Even though I use `my_number` and increase it by 1, the Python interpreter or OS creates a new `int` object and assigns it to `my_new_number`. `my_number` remains unchanged.

```python
# immutability_numbers.py
my_number = 5
my_new_number = my_number + 1
```

Immutability is important. If you attempt to change an immutable object in your Python programs, you'll only know about the error when you run the program. Also, immutability lends itself well to concurrent programming which is advanced software technique to 
# Functions

Functions are reusable "blocks" of code and help break down a complex program into smaller, manageable parts. By using functions, you will reduce repeating code in your programs which is always beneficial.

Functions in Python are first-class objects which mean they're treated like almost any other object. That means you can assign a function to a variable, pass functions into other functions as arguments, return functions from a function and put functions into data structures like lists and tuples.

You know you're dealing with a function in Python if you see a name followed by `(`and ending with `)`. Examples:

```python
my_list = [1,2,3]

print() # name of function is print
len(my_list) # name is len; short for length. Returns length of an object
str(99) # name is str; short for string; converts an object to string
```
## Defining your own function

To define a function, you use the keyword `def` like so:

```python
# my_function.py

def my_function():
	print('Hello, world!')
    return 1
```

`def` is the keyword that tells the Python interpreter that you're about to create a function.
`my_function` is the name of your function
`()` these parentheses are a visual indicator that this is a function
`:` the code after the colon is what the function will execute when its called
`print('Hello, world!')` will run each time I call `my_function`
`return 1` means `my_function` gives back the value `1`

I can call `my_function` in a script like this:

```python
# call_function.py

def my_function():
	print('Hello, world!')
    return 1

my_function()
```

Output:

```
> python call_function.py
> Hello, world!
```

You can call your function as many times as you want.
## Parameters

In the last example, the function `my_function` did not take any inputs. We could simply call it like this: 

```python
my_function()
```

But functions are more useful when they take inputs and use those inputs. Let's look at this example that takes an `input_number` and adds 1 to it then prints it:

```python
# function_with_param.py

def add_one(input_number):
	print(input_number + 1)
```

I can call this function:

```python
# function_with_param.py

def add_one(input_number):
	print(input_number + 1)

print(add_one(5)) # I've called the function add_one
```

Output:

```
> python function_with_param.py
> 6
```

Your function can have more than one parameters. The general format stays same:

```python
# function_multi_param.py

def multiply(number_one, number_two):
	return number_one * number_two

print(multiple(2, 4))
```

Output:

```
> python function_multi_param.py
> 8
```

### Named parameters

When you call a function, you can use the parameter names in the function call:

```python
def multiply(number_one, number_two):
	return number_one * number_two

print(multiply(number_one=5, number_two=10))
```

Order of the named parameters doesn't matter either. Below, I switch the order of the parameters when I call the function, but since I'm using named parameters, the Python interpreter can figure that out for me.

```python
def multiply(number_one, number_two):
	return number_one * number_two

print(multiply(number_two=5, number_one=10))
```

***Used named parameters when possible. It makes it clear which arguments (values) you're assigning to each parameter***.
### Default parameter values

You can also set default values on your function parameters:

```python
# function_parameter_defaults.py

def multiply(number_one=10, number_two=5):
	return number_one * number_two

print(multiply())
```

Output:

```
> python function_parameter_defaults.py
> 50
```

Notice, I didn't supply any arguments (values) when I called `multiply()`. That's because if no values are provided, the default values are used, in this case, 10 and 5.
## Return values

The final component of a function is its return value(s). Not all functions need return values, but most will. A `return value` is some value or object (even functions) that the function gives back to you. When your function reaches the `return` keyword, it stops execution there.

```python
# func_return_values.py

def return_hello():
	return 'hello'

print(return_hello())
```

Output:

```
> python func_return_values.py
> hello
```
### Saving a return value

You can save the return value of a function into a variable.

```python
# save_return_value.py
hello = return_hello()

print(hello)
```

Output:

```
> python save_return_value.py
> hello
```
### No return values

```python
# no_return_values.py
def greeting(name='Jon'):
	full_greeting = 'Hello, ' + name
	print(full_greeting)

saved_greeting = greeting('Jon')
print(saved_greeting)
```

Output:

```
> python no_return_values.py
> Hello, Jon
> None
```

We tried saving the return value of the function greeting `greeting` but it doesn't return anything. So when we tried printing `saved_greeting`, `None` was printed.

## Working with files

### Opening a file

The function `open`, provided by the Python standard library, is used to open a file. `open` returns a  The two most common parameters are:

`file` - the path to the file
`mode` - the mode in which to open the file

Below is a table of the different `mode` values:

| Character | Meaning                                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `'r'`     | open for reading (default)                                      |
| `'w'`     | open for writing, truncating the file first                     |
| `'x'`     | open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists |
| `'a'`     | open for writing, appending to the end of file if it exists     |
| `'b'`     | binary mode                                                     |
| `'t'`     | text mode (default)                                             |
| `'+'`     | open for updating (reading and writing)                         |
#### Reading line by line

Open a file for reading that exists in the folder where `open_file_manual.py` exists.

```python
# open_file_manual.py

opened_file = open('<FILENAME', 'r')
first_line = opened_file.readline()
second_line = opened_file.readline()
```

When you open a file, reading starts at the first line of the file. Each time you called `readline()` on the file object, `readline()` returns the contents of that line as a `str` then moves its position to the next line. When you call `readline()` again, it will return the second line as a `str` and so on.

You can continue calling `readline()` until there are no more lines in the file. You will know when there are no more lines when `readline()` returns `''`. 

To do this with a while loop:

```python
# open_file_manual_while_loop.py

opened_file = open('<FILENAME', 'r')

line = opened_file.readline()
while line != '':
	print(line)
```

Here I'm checking if `line` which is assigned the file's current line, is not equal to `''`. Remember, you are at the end of a file when `readline()` returns `''`.

```python
while line != '':
```

Once `line` equals `''`, then the while loop exists and you're at the end of the file.
#### Reading all lines at once

You can read all of the lines in a file at once and save them to a variable of your choice. The `readlines()` function gets all of the lines and puts them into a `list`. You are then free to do to that `list` what you're able to do to any `list` like slicing, indexing, replacing, adding, deleting, etc.

```python
# open_file_read_all_lines.py

opened_file = open('<FILENAME', 'r')
all_lines = opened_file.readlines()
```

***Be careful with this, as reading in a large file takes up alot of your computer's memory (RAM). We will learn how to avoid this later***

### Closing a file

Be sure to close any files you open with the `open` function:

```python
# close_file.py

opened_file = open('<FILENAME', 'r')
first_line = opened_file.readline()
second_line = opened_file.readline()

opened_file.close()
```

If you don't close a file, then the next time it is accessed, whether by you, your OS or your Python script, you'll get an error saying that the file is in use.
### Opening a file (the safer way)

You can open a file safely this way because it takes care of opening the file and closing it as well. Don't worry too much about the `with` and `as` keywords. We will touch on those later.

```python
# open_a_file.py

with open('<FILENAME>', 'r') as opened_file:
	lines_in_file = opened_file.readlines()
	# process lines_in_file
```

This is the preferred way to open a file, but you are free to manually open and close them yourself.
### Writing to a file

```python
write_file = open('<FILENAME>', 'w')
write_file.write("Hello, world\n")
write_file.close()
```
