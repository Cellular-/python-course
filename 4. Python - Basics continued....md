## Python interpreter as a process

When we run a Python script on the terminal like so:

```
> python myscript.py
```

What's actually happening is the operating system find the Python executable (python.exe), starts a new process (program running in the background) and executes the script in the process.

To prove this, run the Python interpreter from your terminal:

```
> python
```

Then, open up your task manager. You should see a entry in your task manager list called Python. That's the process you created by starting the Python interpreter on your terminal.
## What happens when I create and assign a variable

## Immutability

## High level programming language

# Functions

Talk about what functions are used for. First-class objects. Higher-order programming.
Referential transparency.
## Python's built in functions

## Defining your own function

## Parameters

## Return values
# Input and output - I/O

# Working with files
