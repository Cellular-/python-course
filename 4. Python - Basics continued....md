# Theory refresher

## Python interpreter as a process

When we run a Python script on the terminal using the Python interpreter:

```
> python myscript.py
```

What's actually happening is the operating system finds the Python executable (python.exe), that you installed, starts a new process (program running in the background) and executes the script in the process.

To prove this, run the Python interpreter from your terminal which starts the REPL:

```
> python
```

Then, open up your task manager. You should see a entry in your task manager list called Python. That's the process you created by starting the Python interpreter on your terminal.
## What happens when I create and assign a variable

## Immutability

## High level programming language

# Functions

Talk about what functions are used for. First-class objects. Higher-order programming.
Referential transparency.
## Python's built in functions

Talk about built in functions like print, len, str, etc.
## Defining your own function

def keyword. function signatures. naming your function.
## Parameters

kinds of parameters. `*args` vs `**kwargs`. default values.
## Return values
# Input and output - I/O

# Working with files

# Code Challenge
