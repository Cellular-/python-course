# What is Python? What can it be used for?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed and general purpose programming language [[Appendix#Programming Languages|learn more]]. It is widely used for data science, automation, scripting, web development and more.
# Why Python?

* Approachable
* Deep 3rd party library offerings
* Widely used
* Quickly build things
# How do I run a Python script?

There are a few ways to run a Python script.

You can use the [[Appendix#REPL|REPL]] (read, evaluate, print, loop) which a terminal-based tool that directly executes the Python code you write.

You can create a new Python script (file with .py extension) then invoke the [[Appendix#Python Architecture#Interpreter|Python interpreter]] from the terminal and "give" your .py script filename to it. For example:

`> python3 myscript.py`
# Hello, world!

Printing "Hello, world!" ([[Appendix#Python Architecture#Built-in functions#`print()`|using the `print` function]])  to the terminal is the first thing many software developers learn to do in a programming language. This is "Hello, world!" in Python (.py) in a script named `myscript.py`:

```python
# myscript.py

print('Hello, world!')
```

[[Appendix#Other#Syntax Highlighting|How come the text in myscript.py has different colors?]]

To execute `myscript.py` on a terminal:

```
> python3 myscript.py
> Hello, world!
```
