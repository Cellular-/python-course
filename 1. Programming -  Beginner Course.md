Won't ChatGPT replace software developers eventually? Possibly. Software development has and will change with the onset of artificial intelligence tools. ChatGPT can write code really fast. It can help you debug code. It can even review your own code. I encourage you to use ChatGPT to enhance your learning journey, not replace it.
