# Last topics code exercises

For each of the code snippets below, identify which scope each object or variable is in.

Which scope is `some_string` in?
```python
# stringfunctions.py

def replace_s(some_string):
	return some_string.replace('s', '')
```

Which scope is `start` in?
```python
# counter.py

def counter():
	start = 0
	
	def increment():
		nonlocal start
		start += 1
		return start

  return increment
```

Which scope is `max_errors` in?
```python
# warnings.py

max_errors = 10

def print_warning():
	if max_errors >= 10:
		print('Warning, more than 10 errors')
```

Which scope is `len` in?
```python
# length.py

print(len('Hello, world'))
```
# Modules, packages and imports

Modules and packages are used to structure your code into reusable components. Modules are single files ending with the `.py` extension that contain Python code. Packages are used to group one more modules in a folder.

Modules and packages become important as your projects becomes bigger and more complicated.

Below is an example of a folder named `my-app` containing both modules and packages.

```
└── my-app/ 
	├── crypto/ # Package called crypto
		├── __init__.py # used to indicate the folder is a package
		├── encrypt.py # module inside the crypto package named encrypt
		└── decrypt.py # module inside the crypto package named encrypt
	├── math/ # Package called math
		├── __init__.py # used to indicate the folder is a package 
		├── add.py # module inside the math package named add
		├── multiply.py # module inside the math package named multiply
		└── divide.py # module inside the math package named divide
	├── functions.py # module named functions
	├── greeting.py # module named greeting
	└── scope.py # module named scope
```
## Using modules

Modules are great for separating code by their responsibilities. You could have a module named `crypto.py` that handles things like encryption and decryption. Or a module named `weather.py` that retrieves weather data for a given city.
### Importing a module

Modules that you write are only useful if other developers can import them into their modules and use your code. To do this, you use the `import` keyword.

By importing another module in your own module, you now have access to all variables, objects and functions defined in that imported module. 

Example:

Here is a folder containing a package named `math` and a module named `greet.py`.

```
└── your-scripts/
	├── greet.py
	├── math/
		├── __init__.py
		├── add.py
		├── multiply.py
		└── divide.py
	├── myscript.py
```

Now here is the code inside the `greet.py` module:

```python
def greet_user(greeting, username):
	print(greeting, username)
```

I want to use the `greet_user` function inside my own module `myscript.py`. Here's how to do that:

```python
# myscript.py

import greet

default_greeting = 'Hello,'

print(greet.greet_user('Hello', 'Steven'))
```

This line below tells the Python interpreter to find a module named `greet.py`. Then, the interpreter makes everything inside `greet.py` available in your module.

```python
import greet
```

If you want to reference an object inside `greet.py`, you must use `greet` followed by a period like so:

```python
import greet

greet.greet_user(greet.default_greeting, 'Steven')
```

In the above example, you've imported the `greet` module in your own module, then referenced both the `greet_user` function and the variable `default_greeting`.
## Using packages

Packages are groups of modules and you can create one by creating a new folder on your computer and placing an `__init__.py` file in the folder. Packages make sense when you have multiple modules related to a specific process and you want to logically group them together.
### Importing a package

In the folder structure below, there is a folder named `math` and inside there is a file `__init__.py` and modules `add.py`, `multiply.py` and `divide.py`. Since there's an `__init__.py` file in the `math` folder, we consider this a package.

```
└── your-scripts/
	├── greet.py
	├── math/
		├── __init__.py
		├── add.py
		├── multiply.py
		└── divide.py
	├── myscript.py
```

Let's say there's a function called `two_numbers` in `add.py` that adds two numbers you give the function and returns it. Here's how:

First, import the `add.py` module from the `math` package in your module `myscript.py`.

```python
# myscript.py

import math.add
```

Then, use the `two_numbers` function in your module `myscript.py`.

```python
print(math.add.two_numbers(1, 2))
```

All together:

```python
# myscript.py

import math.add

print(math.add.two_numbers(1, 2))
```

Running `myscript.py`:

```
> python myscript.py
> 3
```

If you want to use the code inside the `multiply.py` or `divide.py`, it's a similar process:

```python
import math.divide

print(math.divide.two_numbers(4, 2))
```

### Importing modules using `from`

If you don't want to write out the package and module name each time, you can use the `from` and `import` keywords.

Example:

```python
from math import add

print(add.two_numbers(1, 2))
```

This translates to "from the math package import the add module into my module". Now, you can reference the code inside the `add.py` module only using `add` instead of `math.add`.

You can make this even more concise (and maybe less clear) like this:

```python
from math.add import two_numbers

print(two_numbers(1, 2))
```

Now, instead of needing `add.two_numbers`, you can directly reference `two_numbers` in your script. This could clause confusion because there may be other functions called `two_numbers` in other modules.

Example:

```python
from math.add import two_numbers
from math.divide import two_numbers
```

Which module is `two_numbers` imported from? `add.py` or `divide.py`?

In this case, the `two_numbers` function from the `divide.py` module is imported. But by looking at the imports alone, this could be unclear.

***It's best to very clear in your code versus unclear.***
